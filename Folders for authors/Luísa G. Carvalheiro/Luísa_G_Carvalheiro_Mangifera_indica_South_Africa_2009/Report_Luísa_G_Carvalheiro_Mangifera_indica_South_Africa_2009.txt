Number of sites: 31

Year of sampling: 2009

Crop: Mangifera indica

Variety: Full information.

Location: Full information.

Country: All reported countries are OK.

Richness: There are missing values (given 15 out of 31).

Taxa constraint: No taxa restrictions have been identified.

Abundance: There are missing values (given 15 out of 31).

Visitation rate units: NA

Visitation rate: There are missing values (given 0 out of 31).

Yield units: early fruit set

Yield: There are missing values (given 14 out of 31).

Alternative yield units: production per tree (stadertization was necessary because the number of trees per plot varied)

Alternative yield: There are missing values (given 11 out of 31).

- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- There are sites without abundance records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without visitation rate records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without richness estimations. Please, check that such information is correct.

- Please check that our information about your recorded taxa (or taxa constraint) is correct.

- There are sites without yield. Please, check that such information is correct. If possible, please provide the missing values (or the corresponding z-scores).

- There are sites without their alternative yield values. Please, check that such information is correct. If possible, please provide the missing values (or the corresponding z-scores).

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.


- Notice that carv03_Bavaria_L_FA1 is repeated. Two values of crop yield (denoted here as yield2) were assigned to such site. We replaced such value by the site mean value for yield.
